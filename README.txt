About:

Projected video artpiece for a MeHackit weekend workshop exhibition held at EMMA - Espoo Museum of Modern Art. All the attendees were scanned with a Kinect. The resulting 3D models were imported to Blender, edited and exported to be used in three.js. The piece also had a QR code next to it to enable mobile interaction.
